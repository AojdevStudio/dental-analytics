## Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive BMad (Business Multi-Agent Development) agent system and Epic 2 architecture documentation for the dental analytics platform. Key deliverables include:

• **BMad Agent System Implementation**: Complete 10-agent specialist system with roles including BMad Master, Orchestrator, Architect, Product Manager, Product Owner, Developer, QA Engineer, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, and UX Expert
• **Epic 2 Architecture Documentation**: Full PRD, Story 2.0 specifications, and developer implementation checklist for historical data analysis and trends
• **CI/CD Security Enhancements**: Improved TruffleHog configuration, branch protection, and code ownership policies
• **Repository Organization**: Structured agent definitions in both .claude and .cursor directories for dual IDE support

## Key Features Added

### BMad Agent System
- **10 Specialized Agents**: Each with defined roles, responsibilities, and interaction protocols
- **Hierarchical Agent Structure**: BMad Master → Orchestrator → Specialist Agents
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Agent definitions for both Claude and Cursor IDEs
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated task delegation and validation processes

### Epic 2 Documentation
- **Product Requirements Document**: Complete PRD for historical data analysis
- **Story 2.0 Specifications**: Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Developer Checklist**: Implementation roadmap with technical requirements
- **Epic List Management**: Centralized epic tracking and priority management

### CI/CD Improvements
- **Enhanced Security Scanning**: TruffleHog integration for secrets detection
- **Branch Protection**: Updated policies for main branch protection
- **Code Ownership**: CODEOWNERS file for mandatory reviews
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive linting, type checking, and testing workflows

## Files Changed (24 total)
- **Agent System**: 12 agent definition files (.claude + .cursor)
- **Documentation**: 5 Epic 2 and architecture files
- **CI/CD**: 5 GitHub workflow and security files
- **Repository**: 2 organizational files (AGENTS.md, app.py updates)

## Test Plan
- [x] **Agent System Validation**: All 10 agents load properly in both Claude and Cursor
- [x] **Documentation Review**: Epic 2 PRD and Story 2.0 meet acceptance criteria
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Quality gates pass with new security configurations
- [x] **File Organization**: All files follow established naming conventions
- [x] **Cross-IDE Compatibility**: Agent definitions work in both development environments
- [x] **Repository Structure**: No broken links or missing dependencies

## Quality Gates Passed
- [x] **Linting**: All files pass ruff and black formatting
- [x] **Type Checking**: MyPy validation for Python files
- [x] **Security Scanning**: TruffleHog secrets detection
- [x] **Documentation Standards**: YAML frontmatter and naming conventions
- [x] **Git Hygiene**: Clean commit history with conventional commit messages

## Breaking Changes
None - this is purely additive functionality that enhances the existing dental analytics platform without modifying core KPI calculation logic.

## Next Steps
With Epic 2 documentation complete, the development team can begin implementing historical data analysis features using the BMad agent system for coordinated development workflow.
