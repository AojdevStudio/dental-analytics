    "2.   Review the Dental Analytics Dashboard PRD at docs/prds/dental-analytics-prd.md and create a minimal \n  UI design specification that:\n\n  1. Displays 5 KPIs on a single screen without scrolling:\n    - Daily Production Total\n    - Collection Rate (%)\n    - New Patient Count\n    - Treatment Acceptance Rate (%)\n    - Hygiene Reappointment Rate (%)\n  2. Applies Kam Dental brand guidelines from docs/rules/brand-guidelines.md:\n    - Primary Navy (#142D54) for headers\n    - Teal Blue (#007E9E) for positive indicators\n    - Emergency Red (#BB0A0A) for below-threshold metrics\n    - Roboto font family\n  3. Maintains radical simplicity:\n    - Zero navigation required\n    - Read-only display (no buttons/inputs)\n    - Desktop-first for 1920x1080 screens\n    - \"Data Unavailable\" error state\n  4. Works within constraints:\n    - Streamlit framework components\n    - Under 200 lines total code\n    - No custom CSS/JavaScript for MVP\n\n  Focus on: Creating a glanceable dashboard where practice managers can instantly assess all 5 metrics.\n   The UI should disappear into the background, letting the numbers speak directly.",
