# Story 2.1a: Multi-Location Frontend UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** practice manager,
**I want** to switch between Baytown and Humble location views in the dashboard,
**so that** I can monitor KPIs for each location independently using the existing backend infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Location Selector Display**: Dashboard displays a clear location selector component (radio buttons or dropdown)
2. **Data Switching Functionality**: Selecting a location updates all 5 KPIs to show location-specific data in real-time
3. **Visual Location Indicator**: Current selected location is prominently displayed in dashboard header/title
4. **Session State Persistence**: Selected location persists during the user session
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when location-specific data is unavailable
6. **Footer Accuracy**: Update footer to accurately reflect current location or "Multi-Location Dashboard"

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add Location Selector UI Component** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create location selector using Streamlit radio buttons or selectbox
  - [x] Position selector prominently in dashboard header area
  - [x] Style selector to match KamDental branding
  - [x] Add clear labels: "Baytown" and "Humble"

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Location State Management** (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Add Streamlit session state for location selection
  - [x] Set default location (Baytown for consistency)
  - [x] Implement location change handling
  - [x] Ensure state persistence across dashboard interactions

- [x] **Task 3: Update KPI Data Calls** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Modify `get_all_kpis()` call to pass selected location parameter
  - [x] Update data loading section to use location-aware calls
  - [x] Maintain existing error handling patterns
  - [x] Test data switching for both locations

- [x] **Task 4: Add Location Visual Feedback** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update dashboard title to include selected location
  - [x] Add location indicator in header (e.g., "KamDental Analytics Dashboard - Baytown")
  - [x] Consider color coding or icons for locations
  - [x] Ensure location is always visible to user

- [x] **Task 5: Update Footer and Error Handling** (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Update footer text to reflect current location context
  - [x] Add error handling for location-specific data failures
  - [x] Display appropriate messages when location data unavailable
  - [x] Maintain existing "Data Unavailable" patterns per KPI

- [x] **Task 6: Testing and Validation** (AC: 1-6)
  - [x] Test switching between Baytown and Humble locations
  - [x] Verify all 5 KPIs update correctly for each location
  - [x] Test error scenarios (missing location data)
  - [x] Validate session state persistence
  - [x] Confirm visual indicators work correctly

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Integration
- Leverages existing `get_all_kpis(location="baytown")` and `get_all_kpis(location="humble")` functions
- No backend changes required - infrastructure completed in Story 2.1
- Location parameter already supports both "baytown" and "humble" values

### Frontend Architecture
```python
# Streamlit implementation approach
import streamlit as st

# Location selector
location = st.radio(
    "Select Location:",
    options=["baytown", "humble"],
    format_func=lambda x: x.title(),
    key="location_selector"
)

# Update dashboard title
st.markdown(f"# ü¶∑ KamDental Analytics Dashboard - {location.title()}")

# Load location-specific data
kpis = get_all_kpis(location=location)
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Maintain existing "Data Unavailable" display for individual KPIs
- Add location-level error handling for complete data failures
- Preserve existing Google Sheets connection error patterns
- Graceful degradation when one location fails

## Definition of Done

- [x] Location selector component displays and functions correctly
- [x] Dashboard shows accurate data for both Baytown and Humble locations
- [x] Visual indicators clearly show selected location
- [x] Session state persists location selection
- [x] Error handling works for location-specific failures
- [x] Footer accurately reflects current location context
- [x] Manual testing completed for both locations
- [x] No regression in existing single-location functionality
- [x] Code quality standards maintained (Black, Ruff, MyPy compliance)
- [x] Documentation updated for new location switching feature

## Dev Notes

### Story Dependencies
- **Requires:** Story 2.1 completion (backend location infrastructure)
- **Blocks:** None - independent frontend enhancement
- **Enhances:** All subsequent Epic 2 stories benefit from location context

### Implementation Estimate
**Effort:** 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)
- Simple Streamlit component addition
- No new backend development required
- Leverages existing error handling patterns
- Straightforward state management

### Testing Notes
- Test both location data displays
- Verify Google Sheets integration works for both locations
- Confirm session state behavior
- Validate error scenarios for each location
