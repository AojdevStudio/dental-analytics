# Story 2.0: Project Structure Refactoring - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the project directories restructured from `frontend/` and `backend/` to `apps/frontend/` and `apps/backend/`,
**so that** I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase with a well-organized project structure that supports future scalability.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current project structure with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
- Technology: Python 3.11, uv dependency management, Streamlit, pandas
- Follows pattern: Clean architectural separation between frontend and backend
- Touch points: All import statements, deployment scripts, documentation references

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Create new `apps/` directory structure in project root
2. Move `frontend/` directory to `apps/frontend/` preserving all files and structure
3. Move `backend/` directory to `apps/backend/` preserving all files and structure
4. Update all internal import paths to reflect new directory structure

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing dashboard functionality continues to work unchanged after restructuring
6. New directory structure follows existing clean architecture pattern
7. Integration with Google Sheets API maintains current behavior
8. Streamlit application startup process remains unchanged

**Quality Requirements:**
9. All existing tests pass after directory restructuring
10. Code quality tools (Black, Ruff, MyPy) continue to work with new structure
11. No regression in existing KPI calculations or dashboard display
12. Documentation updated to reference new directory paths

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree Information:**
```
Current Structure:
dental-analytics/
├── frontend/
│   ├── app.py (80 lines - Streamlit dashboard)
│   └── .streamlit/config.toml (brand theme)
├── backend/
│   ├── sheets_reader.py (77 lines - Google Sheets API)
│   └── metrics.py (92 lines - KPI calculations)
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml
```

**Target Structure:**
```
dental-analytics/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   ├── app.py
│   │   └── .streamlit/config.toml
│   └── backend/
│       ├── sheets_reader.py
│       └── metrics.py
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml
```

**Critical Integration Points:**
- `frontend/app.py` imports from `backend.metrics` and `backend.sheets_reader`
- Tests import from both frontend and backend modules
- Streamlit configuration in `.streamlit/config.toml` must remain functional
- Google API credentials path references may need updates

**Important Notes from Epic-1:**
- Backend (169 lines total): Google Sheets integration, pandas processing, metrics calculations
- Frontend (80 lines): Streamlit dashboard with KamDental branding
- Current system has 99% test coverage that must be maintained
- All 5 KPIs operational: Production Total, Collection Rate, New Patients, Treatment Acceptance, Hygiene Reappointment

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Test files location: `tests/` directory (unchanged)
- Run all tests: `uv run pytest`
- Coverage requirement: Maintain 90%+ coverage
- Quality tools: `uv run black`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run mypy`
- Integration test: Full dashboard functionality via `uv run streamlit run apps/frontend/app.py`

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:** Simple directory move with systematic import path updates
**Existing Pattern Reference:** Maintain clean backend/frontend separation established in Epic-1
**Key Constraints:**
- Zero downtime - existing functionality must work immediately after restructuring
- No breaking changes to external interfaces
- Preserve all file permissions and Git history

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met (new directory structure created and populated)
- [ ] Integration requirements verified (existing functionality unchanged)
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested (all KPIs display correctly)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards (clean architecture maintained)
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and updated import paths)
- [ ] Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md and relevant docs reflect new structure)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Import path errors breaking existing functionality
**Mitigation:** Systematic testing after each import update, rollback plan ready
**Rollback:** Revert directory structure and import changes if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs (directory restructure only)
- [x] Database changes: None required
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (no UI changes)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible (directory structure change only)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Comprehensive review of directory restructuring from `frontend/backend/` to `apps/frontend/backend/`. The refactoring was well-executed with proper import path updates across the codebase. However, critical issues were identified and resolved during review.

### Refactoring Performed

During quality review, the following critical fixes were implemented:

- **File**: tests/test_sheets_reader.py
  - **Change**: Fixed all patch statements from `backend.*` to `apps.backend.*`
  - **Why**: Original refactoring missed updating mock patch paths, causing 16 test failures
  - **How**: Updated import references in 15+ patch statements throughout test file

- **File**: tests/integration/test_full_flow.py
  - **Change**: Fixed SheetsReader patch reference from `backend.metrics.SheetsReader` to `apps.backend.metrics.SheetsReader`
  - **Why**: Integration tests were failing due to incorrect patch path
  - **How**: Updated 6 patch statements across all integration test methods

- **File**: apps/frontend/app.py
  - **Change**: Fixed MyPy type checking errors for None comparisons and Literal types
  - **Why**: Type safety violations could lead to runtime errors
  - **How**: Added proper None checks before numeric comparisons and used specific Literal types for delta_color parameters

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code passes Ruff linting and Black formatting
- Project Structure: ✓ New apps/ structure follows clean architecture patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ All tests pass after import path corrections
- All ACs Met: ✓ Directory restructuring complete with functional verification

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical test import path failures (tests/test_sheets_reader.py, tests/integration/test_full_flow.py)
- [x] Resolved MyPy type checking violations (apps/frontend/app.py)
- [x] Verified Streamlit application starts successfully with new structure
- [x] Confirmed all quality tools (Ruff, MyPy, Black) pass
- [ ] Consider adding project structure documentation in README for future maintainers

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is a pure structural refactoring with no changes to authentication, data handling, or external interfaces.

### Performance Considerations

No performance impact detected. Directory restructuring does not affect runtime performance. Application startup and KPI calculations maintain same performance characteristics.

### Files Modified During Review

The following files were modified during QA review to resolve critical issues:
- tests/test_sheets_reader.py (15 patch path fixes)
- tests/integration/test_full_flow.py (6 patch path fixes)
- apps/frontend/app.py (Type safety improvements)

*Note: Developer should update File List in Dev Agent Record to include QA modifications*

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.0-project-structure-refactoring-brownfield-addition.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, critical issues resolved, tests passing, quality tools passing
