**Quality Requirements Integration**:
- Added explicit quality requirements section
- Updated Definition of Done with quality gates
- Enhanced automated verification checklist
- Integrated quality tools into validation steps

**Impact**: All future stories automatically include quality requirements, ensuring consistent standards across all development work.

### 6. Time Estimation Guidelines
**File**: `docs/time-estimation-guidelines.md`

**Quality-Adjusted Planning**:
- Quality multipliers for realistic time estimates (1.5-1.8x base estimate)
- TDD time allocation guidelines (30% of development time)
- Project-specific factors for dental analytics context
- ROI analysis showing long-term quality benefits

**Impact**: More accurate project planning that accounts for quality practices, reducing schedule surprises and improving delivery predictability.
