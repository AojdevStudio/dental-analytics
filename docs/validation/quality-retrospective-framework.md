# Quality Retrospective Framework

## Framework Overview

This framework establishes systematic approaches for continuous improvement of our quality processes, tools, and culture. It integrates quality-focused retrospectives into our regular sprint cadence while providing specialized formats for deeper quality exploration.

**Philosophy**: Quality improvement is an ongoing journey that requires structured reflection, experimentation, and adaptation.

## Retrospective Types and Cadence

### 1. Sprint Retrospectives with Quality Focus
**Frequency**: Every sprint (bi-weekly)
**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Participants**: Full development team
**Quality Time**: 30 minutes dedicated to quality topics

### 2. Quality-Only Retrospectives
**Frequency**: Monthly
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Participants**: Full development team + stakeholders
**Focus**: Deep dive into quality processes and improvements

### 3. Quarterly Quality Reviews
**Frequency**: Quarterly
**Duration**: Half day (4 hours)
**Participants**: Team + leadership + key stakeholders
**Focus**: Strategic quality improvements and goal setting

## Sprint Retrospective Quality Integration

### Quality Check-In Format (30 minutes)

#### Opening Quality Moment (5 minutes)
```yaml
Quality Metrics Review:
  - Test Coverage: Current vs Target (≥90%)
  - Quality Gate Success Rate: Sprint percentage
  - CI/CD Pipeline Health: Build success rate
  - TDD Adoption: Stories using TDD approach
  - Quality Tool Issues: Blockers encountered
```

#### Quality Celebration (5 minutes)
**What Went Well with Quality**:
- Quality wins and achievements
- Effective use of quality tools
- Good TDD practices observed
- Helpful quality mentoring moments
- Process improvements that worked

#### Quality Challenges (10 minutes)
**What Could Be Improved**:
- Quality tool frustrations or barriers
- Test coverage gaps or challenges
- TDD adoption obstacles
- Process inefficiencies
- Knowledge gaps or training needs

#### Quality Action Items (10 minutes)
**Specific Quality Improvements**:
- Tool configurations to adjust
- Process refinements to try
- Training or mentoring to arrange
- Metrics to track more closely
- Experiments to conduct

### Integration with Standard Retrospective

**Seamless Integration Approach**:
1. Include quality items in standard "What went well" / "What didn't go well"
2. Ensure quality improvements are captured in action items
3. Track quality-related experiments alongside other process improvements
4. Celebrate quality wins as team achievements
