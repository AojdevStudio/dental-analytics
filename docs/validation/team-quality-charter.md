# Team Quality Charter

## Charter Purpose

This charter establishes our team's formal commitment to quality-first development practices. It serves as our collective agreement on standards, expectations, and support systems that enable us to deliver exceptional software consistently while maintaining development agility.

**Core Principle**: Quality is not an add-on to development—it IS development done right.

## Team Quality Commitment

### Our Promise to Each Other

We, the dental analytics development team, commit to:

1. **Quality First Mindset**: Writing tests before implementation (TDD) and treating quality as non-negotiable
2. **Collective Ownership**: Every team member owns the quality of our entire codebase
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly enhancing our processes, tools, and knowledge
4. **Supportive Culture**: Helping each other grow and succeed with quality practices
5. **Transparent Communication**: Openly discussing quality challenges and sharing solutions

### Our Promise to Stakeholders

We commit to delivering:

1. **Reliable Software**: 97%+ test coverage ensures features work as specified
2. **Maintainable Code**: Clean, well-documented code that future developers can understand
3. **Predictable Delivery**: Quality-adjusted estimates that account for proper testing and validation
4. **Proactive Problem Prevention**: Catching issues before they reach production
5. **Continuous Value**: Quality practices that accelerate development over time

## Quality Standards and Expectations

### Non-Negotiable Quality Gates

Every code change must pass:

```yaml
Critical Requirements (Must Pass):
  - All Tests Pass: 100% test suite success rate
  - Test Coverage: ≥90% for backend business logic
  - No Syntax Errors: Clean compilation/interpretation
  - Type Safety: MyPy type checking passes
  - Security Scan: No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities
  - Code Formatting: Black formatting applied
  - Linting Standards: Ruff linting passes
  - Pre-commit Hooks: All hooks must pass
```

### Quality Tools Mastery

Each team member commits to proficiency with:

- **Testing**: pytest for comprehensive test writing and execution
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov for monitoring and maintaining coverage
- **Type Checking**: mypy for static type analysis
- **Code Formatting**: black for consistent code style
- **Linting**: ruff for code quality and best practices
- **Pre-commit**: automated quality validation before commits
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous quality validation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practice

Our TDD commitment:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes desired functionality
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Continue cycle for each new piece of functionality

**Time Allocation**: Approximately 30% of development time dedicated to testing activities.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
