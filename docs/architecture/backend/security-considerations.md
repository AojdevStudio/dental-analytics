# Security Considerations

## Service Account Security
- Credentials file in .gitignore
- Read-only API scope
- No user data storage
- Service account has minimal permissions

## Data Privacy
- No PHI/PII in calculations
- Only aggregate metrics returned
- No data persistence
- Memory cleared after request
