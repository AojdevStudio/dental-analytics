- [ ] **IDE Configuration**: Configure IDE with recommended extensions (Python, Black, MyPy)

### Quality Tools Installation & Verification
- [ ] **Black Formatter**: Verify `uv run black --version` works
- [ ] **Ruff Linter**: Verify `uv run ruff --version` works
- [ ] **MyPy Type Checker**: Verify `uv run mypy --version` works
- [ ] **pytest Test Runner**: Verify `uv run pytest --version` works
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run `uv run pre-commit install` and verify hooks are active

### Development Scripts
- [ ] **Setup Script**: Execute `uv run python scripts/setup-dev.py` successfully
- [ ] **Quality Check**: Execute `uv run python scripts/check-quality.py` and confirm all checks pass
- [ ] **Test Suite**: Run `uv run pytest` and confirm all 29 tests pass with 97% coverage

## Quality Standards Understanding

### Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Understand minimum 90% coverage requirement for backend business logic
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Review requirement for comprehensive type annotations
- [ ] **Code Formatting**: Understand Black formatter configuration and style requirements
- [ ] **Linting Standards**: Review Ruff configuration and understand violation categories
- [ ] **Documentation**: Understand docstring requirements and inline commenting standards

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Review unit test examples in `tests/` directory
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Understand Google Sheets integration test approach
- [ ] **Test Organization**: Review test file naming and structure conventions
- [ ] **Mock Usage**: Understand when and how to mock external dependencies
- [ ] **Test Data**: Review test data management and fixture usage

### Development Workflow
- [ ] **Pre-commit Process**: Understand automatic quality checks before commits
- [ ] **Definition of Done**: Review comprehensive DoD checklist requirements
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Understand GitHub Actions workflow and quality gates
- [ ] **Code Review Process**: Understand quality expectations in reviews

## Hands-On Quality Practice

### Practice Exercise 1: Code Formatting
- [ ] Intentionally create poorly formatted Python code
- [ ] Run `uv run black .` and observe formatting changes
- [ ] Verify pre-commit hooks catch formatting issues

### Practice Exercise 2: Type Checking
- [ ] Create code with missing type hints
- [ ] Run `uv run mypy backend/ frontend/` and review errors
- [ ] Fix type issues and verify clean MyPy output

### Practice Exercise 3: Testing
- [ ] Write a simple function in `backend/` module
- [ ] Create corresponding unit test with 100% coverage
- [ ] Run tests and verify coverage report includes new code
- [ ] Practice TDD approach: write test first, then implementation

### Practice Exercise 4: Linting
- [ ] Introduce linting violations (unused imports, long lines, etc.)
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff check .` and review violations
- [ ] Fix violations and verify clean linting output

### Practice Exercise 5: Integration Testing
- [ ] Review Google Sheets integration test in `tests/integration/`
- [ ] Understand mock usage for external API calls
- [ ] Run integration tests and understand their purpose

## Quality Tools Deep Dive

### Black Formatter Configuration
- [ ] Review `pyproject.toml` Black settings
- [ ] Understand line length limits (88 characters)
- [ ] Practice with complex code formatting scenarios

### Ruff Linter Rules
- [ ] Review enabled rule sets in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Understand violation categories (E, F, W, etc.)
- [ ] Practice fixing different types of violations

### MyPy Type Checking
- [ ] Review MyPy configuration settings
- [ ] Understand strict mode requirements
- [ ] Practice with complex type annotations (generics, unions, optionals)

### pytest Framework
- [ ] Review test configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Understand coverage reporting setup
- [ ] Practice with fixtures, parametrized tests, and mocks

## CI/CD and Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- [ ] Review `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`
- [ ] Understand quality gate requirements for PR merges
- [ ] Observe workflow execution on a test branch

### Pre-commit Hooks
- [ ] Review `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration
- [ ] Understand hook execution order and dependencies
- [ ] Practice with hook failures and resolution

### Quality Scripts
- [ ] Review `scripts/check-quality.py` implementation
- [ ] Understand comprehensive quality validation process
- [ ] Practice running individual quality checks vs full suite

## Project-Specific Quality Standards

### Dental Analytics Domain
- [ ] Review KPI calculation testing requirements
- [ ] Understand Google Sheets API mocking strategies
- [ ] Review Streamlit component testing approaches

### File Organization
- [ ] Understand backend vs frontend testing separation
- [ ] Review test file naming conventions
- [ ] Understand fixture organization and reuse

### Data Validation
- [ ] Review pandas DataFrame validation patterns
- [ ] Understand dental practice data validation requirements
- [ ] Practice with edge case testing for KPI calculations

## Quality Metrics and Monitoring

### Current Quality Baseline
- [ ] **Test Count**: 29 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- [ ] **Coverage Target**: 97% achieved, 90% minimum required
- [ ] **Type Coverage**: 100% type hints on public APIs
- [ ] **Linting**: Zero violations policy
- [ ] **Formatting**: 100% Black compliance

### Quality Tracking
- [ ] Understand how to interpret coverage reports
- [ ] Learn to identify uncovered code paths
- [ ] Practice with quality metric improvement strategies

## Common Quality Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding New Feature
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD approach)
- [ ] Implement with proper type hints
- [ ] Verify quality gates pass before commit
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix
- [ ] Create test that reproduces the bug
- [ ] Fix the bug while maintaining coverage
- [ ] Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Ensure all quality checks pass

### Scenario 3: Refactoring
- [ ] Maintain existing test coverage
- [ ] Preserve API contracts and type safety
- [ ] Verify performance doesn't degrade
- [ ] Update documentation for significant changes

### Scenario 4: Dependency Updates
- [ ] Run full test suite after updates
- [ ] Check for deprecated API usage
- [ ] Verify type checking still passes
- [ ] Update any affected tests or mocks

## Quality Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
- [ ] **Coverage drops**: How to identify and test uncovered code
- [ ] **Type errors**: Strategies for complex type annotation issues
- [ ] **Test failures**: Debugging approaches and isolation techniques
- [ ] **Performance issues**: Profiling and optimization while maintaining quality

### Getting Help

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Full quality check
uv run python scripts/check-quality.py

# Individual tool runs
uv run black .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy backend/ frontend/
uv run pytest --cov=backend --cov=frontend

# Development setup
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
uv run python scripts/setup-dev.py

# Application startup
uv run streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Success Metrics

A successfully onboarded developer should be able to:

1. **Write Quality Code**: Produce code that passes all quality gates on first attempt
2. **Effective Testing**: Write comprehensive tests achieving 90%+ coverage
3. **Tool Proficiency**: Use all quality tools effectively and troubleshoot issues
4. **Process Adherence**: Follow TDD and quality-first development practices
5. **Team Contribution**: Help maintain and improve team quality standards

**Remember**: Quality is not a checkbox exercise - it's about building reliable, maintainable software that serves our users well. These standards exist to help us deliver better software, not to slow us down.
