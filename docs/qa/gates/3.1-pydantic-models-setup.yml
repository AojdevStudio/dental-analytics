review_notes: |
  This implementation represents exceptional software craftsmanship:

  - Perfect 100% test coverage with 74 comprehensive tests
  - Zero MyPy errors, zero Ruff warnings
  - Exemplary documentation with NumPy-style docstrings
  - Proper exception chaining throughout validators
  - Modern Python 3.10+ syntax (dict[], list[], Literal types)
  - Clean architecture with framework-independent models
  - Comprehensive requirements traceability (all 16 ACs mapped to tests)

  The clean break strategy (new files only, zero backend mods) minimizes risk while
  establishing a solid foundation for the remaining Phase 1 migration stories.

  NO REFACTORING REQUIRED - production-ready as submitted.
