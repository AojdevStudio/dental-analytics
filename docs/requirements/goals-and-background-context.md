# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Eliminate 90% of manual KPI calculation time for dental practice staff
- Display 5 critical dental KPIs in real-time from Google Sheets data
- Achieve zero-training deployment with immediate user adoption
- Deliver complete solution in under 200 lines of production code
- Enable same-day visibility into practice performance metrics

## Background Context

KamDental practice currently loses 1-2 hours daily to manual KPI calculations from spreadsheets, creating delays in decision-making and increasing error risk. With dental practices facing tightening margins and increased competition, real-time performance visibility has become critical. This solution leverages the practice's existing Google Sheets workflow to automate the calculation and display of five essential metrics: daily production totals, collection rates, new patient counts, treatment acceptance rates, and hygiene reappointment tracking.

Unlike expensive practice management systems that cost $500-2000/month and require extensive training, this minimalist approach focuses solely on displaying the metrics that matter most. By working directly with the practice's existing data source and maintaining radical simplicity, we avoid feature bloat while delivering immediate value.
