## Communication Notes

Use this section to leave notes for other developers or AI assistants.

### Current Focus Areas
- Import error prevention system implemented
- Pre-commit hooks enhanced with import validation
- Refactoring guidelines documented

### Best Practices Reminders
- Always update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md before major refactoring
- Run `python3 scripts/validate-imports.py` before committing
- Use IDE refactoring tools for function/class renames
- Keep refactoring commits separate from feature work
- Follow checklist in `docs/refactoring-guidelines.md`

### Recent Lessons Learned
1. **2025-09-29**: Function renames must update all imports and calls - implemented automated validation
2. **2025-09-29**: Pre-commit hooks should include import validation - now active
3. **2025-09-29**: Tests should run automatically on commits - enabled in pre-commit config
